# Resume
Literally just my resume.

## License
This repo is forked from [michaelfromyeg](https://github.com/michaelfromyeg/resume)

## Development
If you'd like your own resume website, do four things:

1. Fork the [main repository](https://github.com/michaelfromyeg/resume).
2. Replace `resume.pdf` with your own (and the favicon files).
3. Push to GitHub.
4. Add a CNAME with your website's subdomain.

To get the subdomain to fully work, check out [this](https://anmonteiro.com/2015/08/custom-subdomains-in-github-project-pages/) link.
